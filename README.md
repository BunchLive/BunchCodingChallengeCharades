# Bunch Coding Challenge

Welcome! We are excited you are interested in working for [Bunch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bunch-group-video-chat-games/id1294869021?mt=8).

## Steps
1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your forked repo
3. Work on any of the challenges below for **2 hours** or so.
4. Push your changes to your repo and send the repo to **hiring@bunch.live** and we will review and get back to you!

## Rules
1. You're free to spend as much time as you want on it but don't go too crazy. See what you can do in **2 hours** or less but you can spread it out over time. 
2. Commit often, preferably with emojis ðŸ˜†
3. Have fun with it. 


## Challenges
Feel free to choose **one**, both, or none of these and do your own thing. If you can complete them all - great - but no pressure. Pick the ones that show off what you are great at and do those!

### a) Houseparty Layout

When you run the repo you will see it has a `CrappyLayout` that looks like the following

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MevhBtC.gif" alt="drawing" width="300"/>
  
  How cool would it be to instead render it in a layout similar to the Houseparty app? See below gif for example
 
**Requirements:**

* Handles all 4 layouts correctly
* In the 3 person mode the largest face is on the bottom

**Nice to haves:**

* Animation when a new member add/removed (bonus points if using a custom animation)


### b) Charades Gameplay

Lets implement a simple game! We are going to clone the famous `Heads Up` game by Ellen. We will simplify it a bit though.

**Requirements**

* When you press start game, the bottom buttons dissapear and the game buttons appear
* There is a 3 second countdown
* Able to pass/correct the words to move to the next one
* At the end of the game it can just exit the game
* Game lasts 30 seconds with a sliding countdown

**Nice to haves**

* Animation when you get a word correct/pass that animates the answer over the gif and darkens the background image
* Animation transitioning to the next gif (bonus points if custom)
* Fancier UI elements


In the end you should end up with something similar to this:

 <img src="./src/assets/Charades.gif" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

### c) Something else?

If you have an idea for something else you would like to add to it let your imagination go wild and impress us!

Some ideas:

1. A scoreboard after the game
2. Fancier custom animations (if you can show off some serious animation chops we will love it ðŸ’™ )
3. Ability to drag the people around and change their position / resize them
4. Integrate with redux/rxjs/sagas etc or do a nice refactoring
5. The new Facetime layout
6. Implement voice recognition or video filters ðŸ¤¯
7. Fix the UI for iPhone X
